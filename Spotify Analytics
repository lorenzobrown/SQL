# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

#I wanted to know all of the songs by popular artist Olivia Rodrigo
SELECT artist_name,track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name='Olivia Rodrigo'
ORDER BY track_name

#I determined what the most sad/chill songs
SELECT artist_name,track_name, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy<0.4
GROUP BY artist_name

#I wanted to know the avg duration of all the songs with the most danceability
SELECT avg(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability>0.6

#Here I Calculated the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify Table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above
Show their name,, their average popularity, and label them as "Top Star".
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
